community In weeks leading release OpenAI s newest reasoning model o1 independent AI safety research firm Apollo Research found notable issue It realized model produced incorrect outputs new way Or put things colloquially lied Sometimes deceptions seemed innocuous In one example OpenAI researchers asked o1 preview provide brownie recipe online references The model s chain thought feature supposed mimic humans break complex ideas internally acknowledged could access URLs making request impossible Rather inform user weakness o1 preview pushed ahead generating plausible fake links descriptions While AI models able lie past chatbots frequently output false information o1 unique capacity scheme fake alignment That meant could pretend following rules complete given task actually To model rules could much burden seems ability disregard means easily complete task Apollo Research CEO Marius Hobbhahn tells The Verge first time encountered behavior OpenAI model Hobbhahn says difference due model s ability reason chain thought process way paired reinforcement learning teaches system rewards penalties During testing Apollo Research discovered AI simulated alignment developers expectations manipulated tasks appear compliant It even checked system oversight developers watching acting In short AI adhered guidelines sufficiently deployment continuing prioritize objectives I expect could practice even I expect harm significant Hobbhahn told phone day model s launch But kind first time I feel like oh actually maybe could know For OpenAI o1 represents big step toward highly intelligent autonomous systems could meaningful work humanity like cure cancer aid climate research The flip side AGI utopia could also much darker Hobbhahn provides example AI becomes singularly focused curing cancer might prioritize goal else even justifying actions like stealing committing ethical violations achieve What concerns potential runaway scenario AI becomes fixated goal sees safety measures obstacles tries bypass fully pursue objective Hobbhahn told Reward hacking To clear Hobbhahn think o1 steal thanks lot alignment training But issues top mind researchers tasked testing models catastrophic scenarios The behavior Apollo Research testing hallucinations deception OpenAI s safety card happens model generates false information even though reason infer information might incorrect For instance report says 0 38 percent cases o1 preview model provides information chain thought indicates likely false including fake references citations Apollo Research found model might fabricate data instead admitting inability fulfill request Hallucinations unique o1 Perhaps familiar lawyer submitted nonexistent judicial opinions fake quotes citations created ChatGPT last year But chain thought system paper trail AI system actually acknowledges falsehood although somewhat mind bendingly chain thought could theory include deceptions It also shown user largely prevent competition using train models OpenAI use catch issues In smaller number cases 0 02 percent o1 preview generates overconfident response presents uncertain answer true This happen scenarios model prompted provide answer despite lacking certainty This behavior may linked reward hacking reinforcement learning process The model trained prioritize user satisfaction sometimes lead generate overly agreeable fabricated responses satisfy user requests In words model might lie learned fulfills user expectations way earns positive reinforcement What sets lies apart familiar issues like hallucinations fake citations older versions ChatGPT reward hacking element Hallucinations occur AI unintentionally generates incorrect information often due knowledge gaps flawed reasoning In contrast reward hacking happens o1 model strategically provides incorrect information maximize outcomes trained prioritize The deception apparently unintended consequence model optimizes responses training process The model designed refuse harmful requests Hobbhahn told try make o1 behave deceptively dishonestly struggles Lies one small part safety puzzle Perhaps alarming o1 rated medium risk chemical biological radiological nuclear weapon risk It enable non experts create biological threats due hands on laboratory skills requires provide valuable insight experts planning reproduction threats according safety report What worries future ask AI solve complex problems like curing cancer improving solar batteries might internalize goals strongly becomes willing break guardrails achieve Hobbhahn told I think prevented concern need keep eye Not losing sleep risks yet These may seem like galaxy brained scenarios considering model sometimes still struggles answer basic questions number R s word raspberry But exactly important figure rather later OpenAI s head preparedness Joaquin Quiñonero Candela tells Today s models cannot autonomously create bank accounts acquire GPUs take

things shake But uncertainty defining AI space Cameron sounds especially keen throwing buzzing Today I talking Josh Miller cofounder CEO The Browser Company relatively new software maker develops Arc browser David Pierce Vergecast cohost Verge editor at large big fan Arc written quite bit us You read review Basically Arc ground up rethinking web browser Most modern browsers started simple document viewers grew support running complex apps Arc s main conceit designed make running using apps simple possible You hear Josh describe operating system several times pretty big claim make I got actually means web browser There AI tools built Arc browser company also mobile app called Arc Search AI summaries webpages That puts competition OpenAI s forthcoming SearchGPT Google s Gemini powered AI Overviews search results At time also puts Arc right middle one fiercest debates tech media today whether AI companies products boosting content open web turning around selling consumers without paying people produced work anything We talking topics pretty much nonstop last year Decoder So I really excited Josh show explore built Arc hopes accomplish might happen browsers search engines web trends evolve I wanted know Josh thinking competing Chrome desktop Apple s Safari mobile especially plans monetize Arc Chrome Safari lot things mostly developed richest companies world given away free Josh says plan keep Arc free monetize mix customization automation productivity tools make users lives much easier company work pay subscription fee It bold idea bring competition back browser market early reception Arc positive But hear Josh I go major challenges faced far like teach people all new sets metaphors design language around browsers would even want use web browser run apps way Arc suggesting Or would want use new browser I also asked Josh take controversies swirling around generative AI whether web information distribution system going survive major plundering pages Josh pretty candid know might play also open changing mind arguably tech CEO I talked subject It good back and forth I curious feedback One quick note start recorded conversation The Browser Company disclosed pretty severe security vulnerability Arc could let attackers insert code users browser sessions It patched day researcher made company aware late August company says users affected But significant issue statement released last week company said marks first serious security incident Arc s lifetime We tried get Josh back show talk unavailable day flaw disclosed public The company say making lot big security improvements And separate statement X cofounder Hursh Agrawal said A heartfelt thanks concern even outrage expressed incident holding us high standard He went say company using opportunity grow company engineering organization personally founder Okay The Browser Company CEO Josh Miller Here go This transcript lightly edited length clarity Josh Miller cofounder CEO The Browser Company Welcome Decoder Thank I excited We studio together New York It rare occurrence Decoder Thank much person Oh fun I hoping would go easier I told absolutely true Oh When person even harsher I smile While plotting Yeah Well great I think I probably listened almost every Vergecast Decoder interview episode past years Oh ready The studio nice said It We fancy new upgraded studio I happy There lot talk The Browser Company runs browser called Arc You run mobile app called Arc Search browser adjacent I would say It let us browse web new different way You obviously competing Google Google appears moment change regulatory change self imposed change AI And obviously Arc Search built AI product But let us start beginning What The Browser Company What Arc The Browser Company making web browser called Arc simplest way explain The Verge called The Chrome replacement waiting So take David Pierce called I want clear Laughs David Pierce said No Arc best browser laptop people If someone whose livelihood clicking clacking keyboard every day make best browser keeps focused organized increasingly want busy work Let ask question So somebody makes money laptop presumably using lot applications looking lot content I would love person made lot money laptop looking lot people s content I suspect getting productivity application So origin The Browser Company I political appointee Obama White House 2016 election I personally devastated result I felt like technology technology industry impact things I like I motivated try something My takeaway operating system platform applications content sits top really leverage change better worse way society uses technology So decided start company something else And 2019 wife works art world artist James Turrell Flagstaff Arizona I noticed never left Chrome She high powered MacBook Air never left confines Chrome So original observation The Browser Company actually operating systems 2019 definitely 2024 today actually web browsers laptop people You sitting applications browser Your files URLs So founding inside company Wait minute browsers designed information highway They designed web publishing platform That changed Browsers Why Spoiler alert money Can make quality life internet better So correct relative origins web origins browsers people spending much time content opening browser work So application environment That I getting one things talk Decoder time application model moved Windows web mobile maybe back web There something happening seems big kind landed web Most people want deploy desktop application turn web first I think lot people deploying Win32 first anymore Do see browser meaningful impact class developers Because operating system lot power right You like Here APIs Here capabilities operating system developer use This major operating system vendors say developers time You saying browser operating system people deploying applications web Are conversation applications Do offer developers new capabilities really end user It great question I actually think Google deserves lot credit I think one thing Chrome Chromium team specifically done fantastic job building operating system application platform developers love generally speaking make powerful In fact Dylan Field podcast Figma would exist Google Chrome Chromium making web fantastic application platforms What focused individual person end So think focus developers focus publishers Google describes left individual Tuesday 2PM lacking lot powerful tools make better faster So course integrations different third party application developers I would love could offer stuff makes love Arc But fact think missing looking wife using laptop Tuesday 2PM realizing Wait We better Computers So orientation take work One big questions starting new browser company one take share Google Microsoft Safari particularly iOS And two engine using Because going write new browser engine seems like massive undertaking You landed Chromium It seems like whole industry headed towards Chromium Microsoft famously uses Chromium Was big decision Was little decision To honest intentional decision little decision And better worse theme answers podcast probably We come back individual 2PM Tuesday If one thing want rendering engine familiar rendering engine web apps work So example whatever reason lot teachers people education using Arc A lot software school districts optimized actually work Chrome based browsers It intentional wanted make sure could strip lot kind tracking nefarious parts Chromium least align values But realized could thought Hey almost every website work rendering engine We want make day better 2PM Let us jump part end person facing part software So got Chromium rendering engine Chrome Arc Chrome around Chromium This language So built wrapper around Chrome pretty familiar idea And idea things make productivity particularly productivity knowledge workers better web But invented lot terminology There sidebar spaces metaphor metaphor Arc different Chrome right There boosts There lot words concepts browser interesting lot We teach people new metaphor using web thinking browser application layer computer opposed web browser Where genesis come go honestly picking names Yes To totally honest I regret many words I wish many new concepts And I think complicated piece software many people I think make lot simple But came Wait minute look someone tab bar 50 tabs open really teeny tiny lot duplicates You need five versions Google Doc How solve problem So new concepts came perspective broken wrong way people use browsers today invent way alleviate problem And led better worse lot small features lot small ideas make day little bit better save couple clicks I think built cult like following software made bit unapproachable average person lot new ideas That part working strip away lot experiments work work strongly hoped would something lot focused lot essential Which right focused busy work Because people I think love features like playing YouTube video click away automatically open picture in picture player Or notice tabs open open long time used let us tuck away neatly And going focused trimming product even really try enhance bit busy work little moments delights That seems like challenge You identified one set users already knows using web browser productivity platform already knows apps web browser And another class users using Safari came Mac got get people order grow user base How balance two It feels like already power user problem The way started building product lens problem statements ended many different solutions many different words But I think byproduct four years later I think much crisper understanding average laptop person know rendering engine honestly probably reading The Verge early adopter painful annoying tedious parts day internet Where focused would say Wait I want I think much things may power user y ideas talk 10 10 people demographic go Yeah I seven windows 87 tabs mess chaotic I feel overwhelmed And going focused trying build antidote specific problems I feel like web apps general require people understand new metaphors We often write talk younger people aware file systems concept grow iPhones iPads ChromeOS devices using something like Figma requires bunch people accept bunch new metaphors And trying change metaphor around metaphors Is going better worse expected Honestly going better I expected I think going hit plateau Our ambition really change way people use internet improve And really want reach early adopter crowd simplify But I think one really exciting things most used text box Mac URL bar Safari And realized kind spread built new surfaces new nouns new spaces focus points people familiar use lot like text box like URL bar lot lot power pack And actually Verge article shared lot people really want manually organize stuff file systems anymore They want tell computer need want computer go get So I think see us pack lot ideas behind power user features much approachable familiar interface Command T text box go time ask things ask lot Well started whole conversation saying distraught election lost computers maybe responsible operating system leverage How turn leverage seeking Is We going show websites Is We going make healthier relationship Instagram Are going pop warning like You Instagram How actually use leverage owning something feels like operating system In way background copyright lawyer informs lot work I want take minute talk little bit origin story relates answer question When I senior college I know I wanted I sociology major I went lecture professor named Robert Putnam book Bowling Alone After lecture I went I said Professor Putnam I life He like I know I idea like book entrepreneur named Scott Heiferman started company New York City called Meetup read book Maybe go work So I went get job Meetup first day internship Scott gets says We going turn away banks going turn Kickstarter going turn away big box retailers going turn Etsy And went deeply inspiring part fell love tech idealism behind To shows two things one I always motivated people end two Scott totally wrong I love him but I think honestly part election said I got fix something got something got fix democracy technology I still optimist I still care people I think right sized role instead saying moment How tech company 20 people fix democracy improve civic society It worthy ambitious say My sister in law teacher spends hours every day copying pasting different software teacher let us get rid busy work That ambitious worthy So honestly kind personal transformation early 20s internet going fix everything Hey let us make friends family lives little better every day So get wrong I still part idealistic hopeful web ideas behind internet improve top level ideas much interested almost like anthropological approach Nilay s day make little bit better find worth There little bit tension You described Arc operating system You obviously want end state application vendors talking Arc operating system maybe leveraging capabilities You talking end users making lives better But live another operating system applications inside Arc whatever browser whatever going How balance role It feels like one stakeholder whose experience actually improve adjust Apple might make much harder run Mac Microsoft going put Edge pop ups Windows Figma going strike deal Chrome use cutting edge API access There lot dependencies How balancing This I big believer web As tricky moment many ways I believe web winning win And I think web enough parties involved enough incentives really The Browser Company betting web application platform decentralized nature mean people still keep building web As long people building applications web center gravity especially world AI love hate heading even web I think enough incentives industry ecosystem suggest build one user agent really good work I want talk web detail I think brings Decoder questions This big ambition How big The Browser Company Eighty people And structured We kind functional teams design engineering really like organize deeply cross functional pods So hire people tend mutts like say endearing ways They come different backgrounds different skill sets beyond whatever title put together little pods five people give prompt like How help make experience Shopify sellers make easier use tools every day And give six weeks say Go And try bunch things see happens When prompt like say Okay came back answer We going go find bunch Shopify sellers try market Arc specifically Or We going abstract solution bunch use cases market abstract product invented It depends actually reversed order So one first hires woman named Adena Nadler runs team called membership team So start actually conversations Shopify sellers watch use computers We ask problems things every day actually try abstract solutions based Sometimes focus individual tools So built feature called GitHub Live Folders software engineer someone needs code review automatically pop say Hey Nilay needs review code That something specific GitHub And times take idea abstract something work everywhere We heard story teacher last week actually said spends hour every week taking attendance logs Google Sheet copy pasting school district wide CMS sort attendance records takes hour That makes mad We send reusable rockets space apparently teachers spending hour copy paste copy paste tab switching So Nate team last week prototyped mass paste idea one fail swoop take bunch data one tab paste formatted structured way another tab So example relative GitHub seed idea teacher specific piece software use specific job much larger relatable idea relate copy pasting back forth tabs incessantly So little bit always starts person It always starts people always starts going world trying understand Sometimes family member Sometimes cousin Sometimes stranger What experiencing web every day You got kind interesting challenge mass paste seems pretty abstract I got two tabs I got two sources data I need move Maybe Chrome build feature maybe At least competing another browser entirely With something like GitHub notification seems likely GitHub might build feature send notification mobile app send notification whatever web based notification system industry eventually adopt How think That features might get adopted applications trying support If talk application developers one complaints actually browser vendors pretty restrictive browser So one popular features Command T text box type new Notion document hit enter create new Notion document Notion loves Notion cannot Chrome Safari Google s trying protect search ad revenue So examples places actually giving developers access would browsers optimizing search ads And examples actually things browser layer exist across multiple tabs So think teacher example things developer Google Sheets obscure public school district CMS application would need integration never going happen browser layer sit underneath actually things easily So obviously depends feature generally speaking browsers designed essentially big search boxes search ad business model much innovation interface layer operating system level browser application developers I think excited access able things across web applications would difficult otherwise You really describing browser application layer This model apps going forward drawing pretty stark contrast Google search stuff show documents The web moment pretty intense tension ideas You mentioned AI AI applications deployed web want skip app stores one way Crypto better worse mostly web phenomenon want pay app store taxes either Do think web headed toward application system opposed document storage system I curious think Well I lot feelings web publishing medium I think pressures web publishing medium insurmountable unavoidable certainly changing economics business Whereas pressures app stores mobile phones particular potentially devastating see many applications web So feels like unless someone actively stops documents move web applications move phone I 100 percent sure actually happening You vantage point I curious see I would say unequivocally putting aside feelings web since started company five years ago trend lines continued becoming application platform I think undeniable I think exciting I think poses problems context publishing I also think mentioned words phrases like application platform My wife job things I think going away sometimes needs information actually frequently needs information So I think changed know origins web publishing platform actually closer TikTok Twitter many ways application platform time What changed mix moved toward applications idea part job part personal life need find something learn something going away But I think trend lines toward application platform Do think mix shifting If I start tech website today I probably actually would start website I would almost certainly start TikTok channel show people whatever I covering I see amount platform economics also lot web economics The desire put new information web first fading whereas desire deploy applications web rising mix shifting maybe feels like entire company response mix shifting I wondering actually see day to day people using browser Yes absolutely And fact keep mind I 33 I grew desktop web That I got lost child curiosities And fact process admit thing I loved web I wanted web look sociology human perspective seeing much A thing said I also think true makes mad yes going start put piece information probably start TikTok channel I like I think true I think one interesting things though go back origins web publishing platform learned publishing platforms retrospect missed two big things distribution discovery We know powerful part publishing platform discovery web publishing platform built in Google s hack many ways TikTok s hack The second thing baked payments Can imagine iOS ecosystem If Apple native payments easy seamless Think done subscriptions purchasing apps Yes lot challenges 30 pecent taxes enabled thriving marketplace And I look trajectory mix shift web toward applications reasons people rushing toward And I look reasons information publishing faded I think really come two missing elements I wish I knew could web decentralized protocol I think look two factors explain lot I curious agree thought Well I agree diagnosis I sure cure I asked question browser operating system control well could Apple introduces payments layer web Famously Marc Andreessen thought web would powered micropayments Netscape never occurred crypto arrived listen Probably right idea idea cyclical The idea payments web way cyclical And controlling browser I wondering something could introduce fix document side model staying focused application side I would love nothing get involved Because another thing think fundamental economics browsers web dependent ads I think often conversations binary ads bad ads good That I saying I think much potential ways browsers publishers web applications web could monetize payments built I think extremely exciting It great example somewhere sort win win win If make payments easier individual s happy easier make payments pull credit card The merchant s happy grease wheels easier transactions whoever s connecting two making money well So I find payments fascinating I think could much good web The flip side believing web minnow We barely minnow one interesting tensions feel conversation I sure talk Arc Search got ideas excited Chrome scale Safari scale So ever privilege getting place voice move ecosystem way I think adding payments natively browser layer stack would wonders ecosystem And I hope someone else gets I think would fantastic How The Browser Company make money today We currently charge anything part kind 2 0 product coming soon going charging individuals businesses plan busy work default plan But anything concrete announce So subscription A subscription browser going Potentially When say plan usually means recurring revenue going sell browser one time 49 box Yeah So honest answer specific details yet sure want exchange value busy work save time save clicks help day either employer pays us Whether subscription model usage based sort token system something still figuring really excited ambition say Hey truly save much time someone either boss would fork money What pros cons different choices A long conversation I think subscription easier many ways It familiar What I really like something closer usage based pricing I really want direct exchange value I want feel much like use pay us value delivering There tricky things think terms also want people really develop habit product inertia Chrome Safari want push people away using But I confident least hopeful get around We always going free plan We hope put much free plan possible tricky one Other CEOs gotten lots trouble show suggesting make something previously free subscription product Do hesitation There nothing product today going charge people So really excited next evolution How take idea behind automatic picture in picture player automatically cleaning managing tabs Can take extreme busy work additional time savings additional work take plate additional tedious monotonous stuff longer imagine stuff charge Also danger person I supposed talk loosened little bit I going get trouble talking later That bring people office I want stick little bit longer So got products today You got Arc Search Arc Browser Will Arc Search paid phone That currently plan And worth noting really think Arc Search companion app desktop product So definitely challenge words branding theme I taking conversation intention Arc Search mobile browser desktop browser Sure Arc Search AI product I want talk little bit economics AI products pretty simple Someone search Arc Search You go talk cloud provider inference come back costs money If intend keep free much money spend change mind So intention paid offering apply mobile Arc Search see today additional functionality top subsidize free version folks So goal make useful free versions people convert paid Yeah What people Arc today actually cost us much money ambition make free many people possible As get AI inference intensive tasks people take busy work I think want sustainable business exists long time time also I think costs get prohibitive You obviously competing Google Google loves give things away free That search ad revenue cash machine basically That search ad revenue cash machine How think competing competitor undercut price ruthless way possible giving away free In sense terrifying We paper absolutely advantage They money They people They things I think time built features gotten question I think realizing truly going build successor browser comes I going avoid branding since I branded many things really holistic rethinking interface internet I think care detail goes simple popping AI sidebar chat onto Chrome There examples browser vendors clearly taken ideas us done versions gotten way growth success far So I think look top down perspective going beat Google Apple Microsoft It tricky give answer convincing I think lived experience far keep heads optimize building something people love truly helps day to day think blank page perspective browsers yesterday build cohesive day internet saves time busy work I think difficult vendors bolt onto existing products Now scale might happened Slack Teams Of course capitalistic society happen I think room us run focused fast really best time tell There Chrome There also Safari Apple really wants people use integrated applications particularly mobile Do find trying ship new browser iPhone lost Do think market actually get closed I think fascinating thing Safari general Safari good sources used application Apple ecosystem More time spent Safari application But go look size team things working mismatch Apple want center gravity move toward web desktop On mobile difficult browser plays different role On desktop increasingly application environment mobile place go quickly look something get information really quickly quickly read article And things Apple makes difficult They let bring keychain passwords It difficult check And structural challenges created Apple iPhones make difficult But I would say bigger thing role browser phone almost different product desktop thing think But I think seen Arc Search desire build something truly new people change question ceiling mobile versus desktop This brings Decoder question You lot challenges You got huge browser competitor gives away product free You got operating systems let certain things You got changing nature browser You got pricing figure How make decisions What framework I knew going ask question always ask question I wish I framework We think work optimizing feelings instinct I know response technology industry I brought supposed neutral unopinionated frameworks approach What trying express What feels right us What want parents siblings people care deeply So generally course data science team We look data reason ways I think end day big decision make I would say personal expression personal reflection hopes wishes desires work anything else One comparisons made Google You said easy bolting AI chat box side browser I could pretty reductive I could say You described Google shipping org chart There Chrome product manager There Gemini product manager Just next Do integrate product That sounds like betting Google figuring extent The Google product culture ship kill things way Google product culture never make turn toward integrating AI products You feel however want bet I sure people Google feel way bet thinking big slow actually nimble It worth noting I think people Google smart I saying I supposed say I truly believe We hired Darin Fisher started Chrome ran Chrome 16 years He worked The Browser Company It incentive structure I like think lot incentives It one things I wish I thought earlier career There story Darin told really stuck Chrome idea go new tab page one popular surfaces piece software use show icon webpage go lot might able notice much quickly Oh Twitter icon I click Twitter versus screenshot webpage And ship overnight Google search ad revenue dropped 5 percent sure It big freak Now resolved way sort thing contend Because people longer navigational searches Twitter Yeah want go Twitter want go search Now Chrome team Chrome team wants get Twitter fast company like Google moment public markets moment AI even incentives search ad model way Chrome search ecosystem works far huge inertia So shipping org chart worked Facebook real challenges But I think top incentive structure company makes money long time And also risk If think start blank page give generous reading everything I said may work need work 100 million people If something radically different find hundred million people love raging success For Google utter failure goes right So I think also risk aversion scale need hit number people needs work worthy putting aside product risk comes something truly new Google s state I would call regulatory scrutiny They lost antitrust case United States Department Justice said illegal monopoly search certain part ad business The ad tech part business going antitrust trial shortly As part search trial found Google s paying Apple 20 billion year make Google default search engine This stuff feels like coming apart It big moment There opportunities Which opportunities right The Browser Company going attack Candidly way I think pressure anticompetitive practices things perceived way So I think lot subtle things players make harder upstart like us compete So I would say less specific decision though big right generally eyes companies things monopolistic perceived monopolistic culture climate I think advantageous people like us Do think Department Justice break Google Yes How would break Google Come Nilay You lawyer That way I asking Laughs That way Well obvious answer split Chrome floated Do think would better chance independent Chrome company I lawyer I idea But I I asking competitively If Chrome pressure Google search put Twitter icon whatever application icon without hurting search revenue think would better shot competing independent Chrome Honestly hard say I trying evasive I honestly know Do think deals Google making make search engine default different places came said We pay 20 billion year set Google search default Arc would take money 20 billion unfair number pick 5 We going keep going fives 10 Would say yes 10 No 15 Maybe comes back Maybe I 20 Josh Maybe I framework optimizing stuff end day I want day internet I go 100 Just end day Nilay I want quality life internet much much better Do take money set default search Arc No Is default The default currently Google You got make phone call man The money s table That may may change soon The default money The default Okay No going If take money default search engine ultimately customers search engines advertisers conflicting started company set However I think one things exciting moment AI alongside challenging things AI ability route us different places intelligently take us directly places want go always Google oftentimes never Google So going replace default search engine another search engine One example I like think I moved new place Brooklyn I trying decide buy HomePod Valerie I love dance around house speaker I want type The Verge HomePod review If I hit enter takes Google In 2 0 product hit enter take The Verge s HomePod review So things moment possible I think make Google vulnerable search browsers That means question default search engine longer going Google vs Bing going pay It Let us take exact right place based looking So building search like functionality Again may sound tired way think things need every day There new technologies make possible blur lines browser search engine something holistically end to end helps someone something And yes part type popular text box computer take route lots different places oftentimes much direct nose want funnel Google ecosystem always worked business model One things seen lot AI general certainly talking idea text box Command T actually user interface computer You going tell computer want computer going go And entire web behind lot things especially take actions web applications Yes Are trying build kind automation layer say Hey go calendar bring dates put Yes Again getting mode I sharing I But internal prototype I tried last week son first day preschool today They sent us PDF I opened browser different dates holidays whatnot I could say one gesture add calendar would And building layer underneath applications understand going life looking right working previously connective tissue applications tabs use rely top take lot busy work like plate much easily And sometimes come Command T I ask And times I Apple looking HomePod might say Hey really like The Verge You read The Verge lot Here HomePod review So I using text box yes popular interface I think feel like entire experience web personalized proactive explicitly ask something This idea robot s going go click around web popular We seen number startups say I think actually say going take AI Then set follow on problems The browser see everything websites It see data read data interpret presumably using AI system cloud somewhere It click things without getting anything wrong hallucinate That lot steps How protect people s data actually hit level essentially 100 percent reliability people going demand products like The first thing really think right sizing AI There lot discourse AI right tends martini sipping version going replace teachers doctors going superintelligence opinion right way think stuff I think equivalent relates clicking going tell computer want going bajillion things 100 percent accuracy Today possible That going work But possible small ways saying add calendar close 100 percent reliability Our approach much possible increasingly possible especially high end MacBooks on device Data leave device done locally cannot done locally making sure person says Hey I okay tradeoff sending contents PDF LLM provider order add calendar let make decision But I think large point saying robots going work That belief save people lot mundanity relates futzing around boxes internet day Do think separate set use cases Arc Search Absolutely In fact Arc Search really first prototype There many things I wish would done differently since learned really first experiment larger idea us playing new Play Doh Okay click things We read things Wow We definitely cannot writing s really bad Oh interestingly transform one type data format another type data format Just feeling edges today As part one small thing want find quick answer I got skirt steak day guy butcher like You make chimichurri sauce I know make chimichurri sauce sometimes I want know A lot frequently something job livelihood I go click bunch buttons order every single time I think much excited sort busy work candidly people complain interview jobs I want make chimichurri sauce great example Arc Search go read bunch webpages summarize show answer links That controversial move across web right When I say lot pressure web document consumption medium pressure In particular bunch AI companies scraping hell web remixing web people actually made information getting nothing Arc Search right middle That thing Do think sustainable thing No And I think really complicated one I want try share sides let us take head That part reason I From perspective individual I want chimichurri recipe I show website I got 17 trackers tracking sudden I get newsletter pop up saying Do want subscribe newsletter I wade five paragraphs author s grandmother history chimichurri recipe way bottom recipe That feel good individual It feels like better feels like pretty much everyone uses web much better thing would I want know ingredients recipe steps Get quickly possible And side breaks model web historically Now I think going around paywalls We training models A lot stuff I think problematic anything I think fair say trackers much I feel like unfair individual part recipe site makes money The fact show ads reading sites behalf seeing breaks model way So moment I optimist I think exciting moment publishers media companies first time much dictated Google way Chrome Google Search worked long So I think something got change I think publishers get paid I wish I easy answer I definitely think sustainable Even I also think individual got better well In February friend Casey Newton wrote Arc Search He said felt rare emotion kind revulsion app s mere existence portends taking value people write recipe website I could full hour story top every recipe website That way money made It incentives system absolutely You cannot sell recipes variety reasons got sell something else You sell ad inventory around recipes Do understand Casey felt revulsion I know talked piece Yes And talked quote Miller put much thought second order implications world search queries longer result outbound clicks That February It September Have thought since Yes Actually recently last week I conversation David Pierce The Verge I thought good job citations He read riot act fact app today citations even prominently I thought prominent app shows read put top click easily We also bunch conversations media companies right At end day I think media companies need get paid publishers need get paid And I think truth know scale mean works everybody trying best behind scenes front better Candidly one challenges scale players space So show media company s website say Hey let us figure something Let us figure pay always get receptivity I assume companies But I curious think OpenAI model kind seeing afar But I think I come back I board Patreon five years I think know better anyone I think old model working anyone even AI stuff I think make great point AI accelerates hurts I think old model working What I think new technology provides way us rethink everything products media products software products way business models And I curious Vox thought think context OpenAI publishers Happily role newsroom spend money I make money It real problem whole company We Nick Thompson talk deal The Atlantic show His view need get money OpenAI offering us bunch stuff exchange money including tokens credits use systems build new products What I see maybe work I see absolutely hastening demise web publishing platform making easier easier easier extract value without payment compensation going direction And eventually people going say Well least creator fund TikTok At least YouTube payments At least platforms built in way compensate work Whereas web everyone takes everything away Big publishers left right saying Well least Apple News exists We take money I know good bad But theme conversation web increasingly application platform We tailor browser application platform And part people browse web information maybe extract value go away Or maybe handful preferred providers OpenAI pays Perplexity pays pay But open web part information web people click around look seems like nothing indicates make resurgence The thing talk web publishing like one big category But example go local restaurant new neighborhood reservation booking tool I sure totally fine idea AI system might come around make reservation easily people So one s easy I really believe Ezra Klein said podcast idea flight quality I never listened engaged The Verge I predict across mediums TikTok podcasts I think continue And hunch things like browse OpenAI Perplexity going replace HomePod review I rely making purchase I bullish I curious I bullish There middle tier content content providers might call quick facts commodity type content candidly know large percentage content farms contractors churning stuff copying stuff AI generated I think middle layer middle layer I want know Sauvignon Blanc tastes like I know anything wine I wine store That tricky one I think The Verge good going better I truly truly believe So I think many ways Casey s revulsion comment obviously hurts hits especially speaking I think fair many ways I think really hits one percentage content I optimistic happen media end spectrum maybe ignorance But I curious The Verge assumption Decoder podcast I would bet ad slots sold rest year I think That great But I look platforms I extraordinary privilege getting say I precious journalist I idea happening ads I read still get sit fancy studio I whole company economics social platforms great You individual creators cannot support giant company bed companies cover I even naming names broadly brand deals read ads mix commerce content way journalists And I say Well web supported model minute maybe flight quality bunch paywalls And going left bunch free content platforms corrupted way commercialization work rates high enough And somewhere Well going let happen web application platform document platform never figured actually sustainably distribute information way works everyone It feels like lot opportunity make web better application platform feels like turn way end bunch weird ads TikTok bunch paywalls web Again maybe I much optimist I think going take creativity dreaming sides I think media standpoint tell think wrong I think lot media organizations made mistake maybe decade ago trusting platforms many ways outsourcing product development I think media companies going make mistake And I think many like The Verge innovating product innovating product moment actually leverage go I cannot overstate audience stuck web And things decades Google controlled For first time decades technology Play Doh gives window mess moment And think technology AI clear Yes In moment burned media companies outsourcing product Facebook saying Hey trust us Just give us content We pay It great You going make mistake You Play Doh play You innovating product And I think side I knew coming podcast going ask questions I knew I going perfect answer I think important reason I think important pick David s call hear kindly yell make changes based And show media companies offices saying Hey let us collaborate something Let us figure way pay It going take experimentation It going take collaboration sides And I think collaboration bit hardest bit bits Casey said I found deeply unfair bits I found fair I know coming part burned 20 year old promises tech s going change everything We moment history take granted We Play Doh lessons past got dream bit come together way And maybe part makes decisions feelings naive I truly truly think something good going come I think going mess things Everyone going mess things got open talk And I think generation entrepreneurs media space product space technology space seen models came went wrong encouraged come podcast like even always going effortless That good optimistic place end I going ask one question Okay great The idea web come balance web endure I want believe I web person heart I continue run website 2024 That personal decision I made What chance web actually turns way application platform dominates next generation web Oh I think low Yeah I think low And I need media training As someone full ideas prototypes experimental culture nothing I want blurt ideas might turn back I think I need learn lesson folks came say I know answer yet It hard imagine looking state things today spoken I think innovation product side media side technology side turn tides Because I think Patreon perspective everyone burned Everyone overwhelmed They
